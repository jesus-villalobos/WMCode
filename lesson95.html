            <h2>Python Terminal:</h2>
            Use this terminal to test the code below, and to experiment with the things in this lesson!
            <b>IT MAY TAKE A MOMENT TO POP UP AND BE READY FOR USE</b>
            <br>
            To open the Python terminal:
            <ul>
                <li>Click the 'Shell' tab below</li>
                <li>Type 'python3' (without the quotes) into the first line</li>
                <li>Run code!</li>
            </ul>
            <b>NOTE:</b> Code will not auto-indent in the Python terminal, so you will have to use "tab" to indent
            lines that need indentation.
            <br>
            <b>NOTE:</b> If the terminal does not let you keep typing in the, refresh the page and try again.

            <h2>Lesson Content:</h2>

            Before continuing, although we won’t use them right away, it is good to note that there are
            additional methods for us to use on lists. On a list, lst, they are:
            <ul>
                <li>lst.remove(*item*) - Removes *item* from the list if it exists</li>
                <li>lst.reverse() - Reverses the order of the list</li>
                <li>lst.index(*item*) - Returns the index of *item* in the list</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Real Application of Lists</h3>
            <p>
                Suppose we are programming an application that hosts a large number of students.
                We want to greet them all, so our first task is to write a method that will take care of this for us.
            </p>
            <p><i>How can we do this now?</i></p>

            <h4>Greeter -- Simple</h4>
            <p>See the recording for a better walk-through!</p>

            <p>As a beginning, the easiest way to accomplish this task is to iterate through the given list with
            the needed information, and extract it using indexing. We can make use of our <i>while loop</i> to
            make this lookup and extraction extra simple.</p>

            <p>This will look something like:</p>
            <pre>
def greeter(lst):
	counter = 0
	while counter < len(lst):
		print("Hello " + lst[counter] + "!")
		counter += 1
</pre>

            <h3>New Situation</h3>
            <p>Now that we solved the greeter problem, our product manager approaches us
                with a different problem. They say:</p>

            <p><i>“There was an error in the names where the first third of every list contained fake names.
                Modify your greeter method to only greet the second and third thirds of every list.”</i></p>

            <p>Let's go through different approaches.</p>


            <h4>Approach 1 -- Building on Indexing</h4>
            See the video for a better walk-through! We can simply build off what we already did above,
            and add a condition. It will look something like:
            <pre>
def greeter(lst):
	counter = 0
	while counter < len(lst):
		if counter > int(len(lst) / 3):
			print("Hello " + lst[counter] + "!")
		counter += 1
</pre>

            <h4>Approach 2 -- List Slicing</h4>
            While the last approach definitely works, there is a much more efficient way to get <i>only</i> the
            information that we need from the given list. We are going to use a new concept known as
            <b>list slicing</b>. Quite literally how it sounds, we are going to cut the input list down to the
            second and third thirds (the last 2 parts) of the list.

            <p>List slicing notation is:</p>
            <pre>*LIST*[*start_index* : *end_index*]</pre>
            There are 3 variations to using a slice that are typically used. They are:
            <pre>
*LIST*[: *end_index*]       → “from the beginning to *end_index*”

*LIST*[*start_index* :]     → “from *start_index* to the end”

*LIST*[ : ]                 → “from the beginning to the end”
</pre>
            We can put this together with our list accessing using a while loop, and come up with a function like:
            <pre>
def greeter(lst):
    counter = 0
    slice = len(lst) // 3
    new_lst = lst[slice:]
    while counter < len(new_lst):
		print("Hello " + new_lst[counter] + "!")
		counter += 1
</pre>

            <h3>One More Job</h3>
            Now, suppose our product manager approaches us with a different problem:

            <p>“Great job with fixing greeter! Now, we have decided that our users need to be greeted
                differently depending on when they joined our platform:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If they joined at a multiple of 5, greet them saying, "You are a chosen one, ___"</li>
                <li>If they joined at an even position, greet them saying, "Welcome in, ___!"</li>
                <li>If they joined at an odd position, greet them saying, "Why hello there, ___ :)"</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Now, we can put together what we've learned with if-elif-else blocks and come up with a
                somewhat long solution, but, in my opinion, the easiest one. It would be something like:</p>
            <pre>
def greeter(lst):
    slice = int(len(lst) / 3)
	new_lst = lst[slice:]
	counter = 0
	while counter < len(new_lst):
    	if counter % 5 == 0:
        	print("You are a chosen one, " + new_lst[counter])
    	elif counter % 2 == 0:
        	print("Welcome in, " + new_lst[counter] + "!")
    	else:
        	print("Why hello there, " + new_lst[counter] + " :)")
    	counter += 1
</pre>
