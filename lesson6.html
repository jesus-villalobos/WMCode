            Use this terminal to test the code below, and to experiment with the things in this lesson!
            <b>IT MAY TAKE A MOMENT TO POP UP AND BE READY FOR USE</b>
            <br>
            To open the Python terminal:
            <ul>
                <li>Click the 'Shell' tab below</li>
                <li>Type 'python3' (without the quotes) into the first line</li>
                <li>Run code!</li>
            </ul>
            <b>NOTE:</b> Code will not auto-indent in the Python terminal, so you will have to use "tab" to indent
            lines that need indentation.
            <br>
            <b>NOTE:</b> If the terminal does not let you keep typing in the, refresh the page and try again.

            <h2>Lesson Content:</h2>

            <h3>Boolean Values - Motivation</h3>
            To motivate what Boolean value is, and what it does, let's play a guessing game.
            <br>
            ** See the slides for a full demo of the guessing game **

            <h3>Coding Demo</h3>
            To gain a better understanding of what is going one, it is best that we write what Python is actually interpreting
            under its magical hood.
            <br>
            First, we intuitively write out our code with helper functions that will determine what is happening in
            comparisons, without any effort. We compare their return values to <b>True</b> and <b>False</b> because it
            makes sense. Here's what we will have at this point:
            <pre>
real_num = 10

def over_under(guess):
“““over_under is a guessing game that uses user input to generate hints.”””
    if guess == real_num:
        print(“Yay! You guessed it!”)
    elif is_over(guess) == True:
        print(“Try something lower than that.”)
    elif is_under(guess) == True:
    print(“Try something bigger.”)
</pre>

        After deciding that this implementation WILL work for anything, then we can move onto out helper functions, and
        decide how to write them. **See the video for more about these helpers.** After writing them, they may look like:
        <pre>
def is_over(guess):
    return guess > real_num

def is_under(guess):
    return guess < real_num
</pre>

            <h3>What Just Happened?</h3>
            <h4>As humans, we ask ourselves:</h4>
            <i>“Is the current guess over or under the true value?”</i>
            <br>
            We get, as a response:
            <i>“Yes”</i> or <i>“No”</i>.

            <h4>Python is a little more sophisticated. It asks:</h4>
            <i style="color: blue;">is_over(guess)</i> or <i style="color: blue;">is_under(guess)</i>?
            <br>
            It expects:
            <i style="color: orange;">True</i> or <i style="color: orange;">False</i>.


            <h3>Comparing Humans and Python</h3>
            Both humans, and Python seek either of a:
            <ul>
                <li>Positive response, or</li>
                <li>Negative response,</li>
            </ul>
            And will do something differently depending on the response.

            For us, it is very easy to determine what is over/under, left/right, next/last, etc.
            <br>
            But, we have various different ways of expressing these things; a funny look, a slap on the wrist, getting yelled at, etc.
            <br>
            For Python, there are only certain things that can represent either a yes or no. These values are split into two
            categories:
            <ul>
                <li>False-y values, and</li>
                <li>Truth-y values</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Python Boolean Values</h3>

            <h4>False-y Values:</h4>
            Python has 4 types of <b>False</b> values:
            <ul>
                <li>Empty objects</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Strings, Array, Lists, and Dictionaries</li>
                    <li>We will talk more about all of these in later lessons.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>The number 0</li>
                <li>The value <i style="color: orange;">null</i>, and</li>
                <li>The value <i style="color: orange;">False</i></li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Truth-y Values</h4>
            Python has one main type of <b>True</b> value.
            <ul>
                <li>Everything that is not <b>False</b></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Objects with data stored in them.</li>
                    <li>Any number not 0, and</li>
                    <li>The value <i style="color: orange;">True</i></li>
                </ul>
            </ul>


            <h3>Refactoring Our Code</h3>
            Though our functions from earlier were nice, and pretty, they were actually quite clunky. By taking advantage of
            boolean identities, we can actually make things a lot easier to read, and completely get rid of our helper functions.
            <br>
            Our new function may look something like this:
            <pre>
real_num = 10
def over_under(guess):
    “““over_under is a guessing game that uses user input to generate hints.”””
    if guess == real_num:
        print(“Yay! You guessed it!”)
    elif guess > real_num:
        print(“Try something lower than that.”)
    elif guess < real_num:
        print(“Try something bigger.”)
</pre>
            (See the video for more notes on how this is actually better!)


            <h3>Now, Why Are Booleans Useful?</h3>
            Boolean values serve as additional levels of robustness for our code.
            <br>
            Booleans make special cases easy to catch, with minimal code.
            <br>
            Keeps redundancy away.
            <br>
            We don’t have to write functions to explicitly tell Python what is good or bad.


            <h3>Final Note</h3>
            If you are ever curious about what something in Python's boolean return value is, you can use the
            built-in Python <b style="color: blue;">bool()</b> function with your item as the parameter, and Python
            will tell you!!
