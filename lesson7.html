            <h2>Python Terminal:</h2>
            Use this terminal to test the code below, and to experiment with the things in this lesson!
            <b>IT MAY TAKE A MOMENT TO POP UP AND BE READY FOR USE</b>
            <br>
            To open the Python terminal:
            <ul>
                <li>Click the 'Shell' tab below</li>
                <li>Type 'python3' (without the quotes) into the first line</li>
                <li>Run code!</li>
            </ul>
            <b>NOTE:</b> Code will not auto-indent in the Python terminal, so you will have to use "tab" to indent
            lines that need indentation.
            <br>
            <b>NOTE:</b> If the terminal does not let you keep typing in the, refresh the page and try again.

            <h3>The <b style="color: blue;">while</b> Loop - Motivation</h3>
            In order to effectively introduce the idea of what the while loop does, let's look at a real-
            life example of where a loop is used. The example that we are going to use is:
            <br>
            <i>Students getting lunch at lunch-time.</i>

            <h4>Demonstration</h4>
            To visualize this situation, we can think of any arbitrary line of students. The line can have any
            number of students in it, and during the lunch period, all of them must recieve lunch. The best way
            to ensure that everyone gets their lunch is:
            <ol>
                <li>Serve lunch to the first student in line</li>
                <li>Continue serving lunch to the students behind them until there is no one left</li>
            </ol>
            <b>This simple process will work for ANY number of students.</b>

            <br>

            <i>See the slides for a more involved, visual demonstration, or the video for a walk-through
            of the problem by Jesus.</i>



            <h3>Analysis and Intuition</h3>
            Looking at a loop like this, we recognize that it is a fool-proof method of making sure that all
            students get their lunch. <b>While</b> there are still students in line, whoever the lunch-person
            is will continue serving lunch. This loop (serving lunch) will only end once there are no students
            left in the line.

            <br>

            If we think about this intuitively, we still go through the exact same steps that we went through
            in the section above, just a little more clearly:
            <ol>
                <li>We start off with a set number of students</li>
                <li>While there are still students left in the line, we will serve lunch</li>
                <li>Once there is no one left in the line, we will stop serving lunch</li>
            </ol>
            This intuitive definition is exactly what we need to write implement this problem into Python code.



            <h3>The <b style="color: blue;">while</b> Loop</h3>
            The <i style="color: blue;">while</i> loop is a special unit of Python's control-flow syntac that
            allows us to do <i>something</i> (purposefully vague) while a condition is
            <i style="color: orange;">True</i>.
            <br>
            In this case, we will serve lunch <i style="color: blue;">while</i> there are students to serve.

            <h4>The Initial Condition</h4>
            Quite intuitively, we need some condition that begins as <i style="color: orange;">True</i> and
            eventually becomes <i style="color: orange;">False</i>.
            <br>
            More often than not, we are going to make use of the Python operators
<pre style="width= 40%"><      <=       >       >=      !=</pre>
            to compare an end-goal with some sort of a count.
            <br>
            For the example of the lunch line, this can look something like:
            <pre>
students_in_line = 25
while students_in_line > 0
</pre>

            <h4>The Body</h4>
            After we have our initial condition set up, we need to give our while loop its own body.
            This is where we’ll put anything that we want to happen in every iteration.
            <pre>
students_in_line = 25
while students_in_line > 0:
    print(“One more student got lunch!”)
</pre>

            <h4>The End-Condition</h4>
            <b>It is VERY important to make sure that our loop ends eventually, we need to make sure that
            our condition eventually becomes False.</b>
            To do this, we need to decrease the number of students_in_line after every step in our loop.
            That will look something like:
            <pre>
students_in_line = 25
while students_in_line > 0:
    print(“One more student got lunch!”)
    students_in_line = students_in_line - 1
</pre>


            <h3>Refactoring Loop to Function</h3>
            Up until this point, our loop stands on its own. With a few minor changes, we can alter our
            loop into a fully user-enabled function.

            <h4>Step 1: Function Name and Parameter</h4>
            By now, we know that function names are important in making sure that our code is readable
            and understandable. So, quite intuitively, a good name for this function would be
            <i style="color: blue;">serve_lunch</i>.
            To make this new function ready to serve lunch to ANY number of students, we can pass in
            the number of <i style="color: orange;">students_in_line</i> as a parameter to our function.
            This will look like:
            <pre>def serve_lunch(students_in_line)</pre>

            <h4>Step 2: Docstring</h4>
            We can simply, include all of the things that we have talked about, previously, as our documentation
            for this function. The name of the function is already quite telling of what it will do, but
            documentation is never bad. It will look something like:
            <pre>
def serve_lunch(students_in_line):
    """serve_lunch will serve lunch to however many students_in_line there are."""
</pre>

            <h4>Step 3: Function Body</h4>
            The final step is to move the loop down from the previous sections. So, putting everything
            together, and adding one final closing statement, our final function is:
            <pre>
def serve_lunch(students_in_line):
    """serve_lunch will serve lunch to however many students_in_line there are."""
    while students_in_line > 0:
        print(“One more student got lunch!”)
	    students_in_line = students_in_line - 1
    print(“All students got lunch!”)
</pre>


            <h3>A More Involved Examlple</h3>
            In this example, we will tie together all of the concepts that we have covered in these lessons
            thus far. This example will include:
            <ul>
                <li>Variables and Assignment</li>
                <li>Operators</li>
                <li>Functions</li>
                <li>Boolean Operators</li>
                <li>The While Loop</li>
            </ul>
            You can watch the full walk-through in the video. There, there is a full walk-through of the function.
            The end product is:
            <pre>
def make_even(x):
    """Iterate through values from 0 to x. Even numbers
    are going to be printed. Odd numbers are going to be multiplied by 3 and have 1 added to them.

    >>> make_even(10)
    0
    4
    2
    10
    4
    16
    6
    22
    8
    28
    10
    """
    current_value = 0
    while current_value <= x:
        if current_value % 2 == 1:
            print(current_value * 3 + 1)
        else:
            print(current_value)

        current_value = current_value + 1
</pre>
            <b>Can you find all of these parts in the function?</b>
